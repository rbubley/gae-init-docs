1.  Clone the gae-init sample app to your local machine (from the GitHub repository):

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init.git hello
    ```

2.  Go into the directory that now contains the sample app code:

    ```
    cd hello
    ```

3.  Install the third party dependencies:

    ```
    yarn install
    ```
    
    (From time-to-time some packages try to pin particular versions of nodejs, if that happens you may need to use `yarn install  --ignore-engines`.)

Alternatively, you can [download the project](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/archive/master.zip) as a zip file and extract it into a directory named `hello`.
